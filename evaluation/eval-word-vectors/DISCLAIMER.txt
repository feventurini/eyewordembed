As correctly reported in the MIT LICENSE file, this folder is taken from the repository https://github.com/mfaruqui/eval-word-vectors,
(see also website http://www.wordvectors.org/).

Some of the scripts were readpted to work with my project, but the bulk of the work is from the original authors:
"Manaal Faruqui and Chris Dyer, Community Evaluation and Exchange of Word Vectors at wordvectors.org".
